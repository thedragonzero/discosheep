or if there's not enough room for a party (in a tunnel not big enough to spawn sheep or ceiling too low, as in above) then show an error message that the party can't start

just thought of something brilliant, maybe an option to toggle a player so that he is frozen while the sheep are dancing around him/her? Not necessary but silly

Any chance of a command that randomly recolors sheep (permanently) within a set distance of the player? And if possible it also removes x amount of an item (eg/redstone 331) from inventory in order to do the command? That would be a super cool addition to any server then!
